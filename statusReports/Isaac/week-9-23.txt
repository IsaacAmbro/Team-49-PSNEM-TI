Status Update for week of 9/23/2024:
This week I worked on the FSR, ICD, Execution Plan and Validation Plan. 
I also began working on the subystem introduction project in which I finished the blinking LEDs and am working on the "hello world" UART program.
Finally, I began working on the introduction presentation.
My plan for the rest of the week is to finish my subsytem introduction project, documents, and my parts of the presentation.
