Status Update for week of 9/30/2024:
This week I completed the FSR, ICD, Execution Plan and Validation Plan. 
I also worked on the introduction presentation.
Finally, I finished working on the subystem introduction project in which I made the blinking LEDs and "hello world" UART programs.
My plan for the rest of the week is to begin creating the shematic for my subsytem in Altium.
