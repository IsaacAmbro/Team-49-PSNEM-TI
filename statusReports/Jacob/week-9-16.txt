Status Update for week of 9/16/2024:
This week I began using Altium to design part scheamtics.
I have completed making the schematic for the chosen DAC which did not have a premade schematic in Altium.
Additionally, I have begun designing the overall schematic for the subsystem. I have a basic desgin for the control relays and am in the process of designing and choosing parts, this is my current issue as I am having trouble figuring out which voltage/current values I should be aiming for and how to design and pick parts around those values.
I am currently attempting to design the values for the chosen DAC, MCU, and the required LDO.
My plan for the next two weeks is to have the basic design done with most if not all of the parts chosen.
I also need to communicate with Isaac to make sure the voltage/current values the MCU is capbable of sending as I design the control relays.
