Status Update for week of 9/30/2024:
This week I helped finish work on the FSR, ICD, Validation Plan, and Milestones documents.
I also helped finish work on the presentation.
I am still working on the introductory project and hope to have that done soon.
I plan to continue working on the schematic and PCB design and will hopefully have that completed by the end of next week.
