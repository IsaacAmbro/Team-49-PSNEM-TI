Status Update for week of 9/23/2024:
This week I helped finish work on the FSR, ICD, Validation Plan, and Milestones documents.
I aslo backracked and began working on the introcutory project. I have created the schematic and footprint for the op-amp.
I have a basic layout for the op-amp schematic and will soon begin to create the PCB routing.
By the end of the week I plan to have finished the introductory project and resumed work on the actual project.
