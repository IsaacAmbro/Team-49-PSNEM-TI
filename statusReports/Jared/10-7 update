Realized I didnt post this for Tuesday whoops
-Finished subsystem demo proj, need to find time to demo though, and gotta make sure It runs on my laptop (it should last I checked)
-Must start work in altium [the most difficult part I think, biggest worry]
-Gotta pick an ADC that matches our DAC [which may be changing resolution, have to check with Jacob]
