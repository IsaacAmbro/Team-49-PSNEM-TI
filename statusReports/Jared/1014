realized I didnt post this last night [10/14] so Im doing it before lab

-Worked in altium, setup esp32 in it 90%, picked ADC that should work. Need to hook up ADC to esp [which should be easy just need to check one or two things], then just need to make sure Ive chosen proper connectors.

need to do:
-finish pcb schematic and layout
-code for esp32
