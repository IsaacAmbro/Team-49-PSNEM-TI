Weekly update 9/23
Frankly not where I wanted to be. Worked on our reports, will finish up my parts on our execution timeline tonight (9/23) in time for our weekly meeting during lab time as well as have things to point out and clarify
Coding environments on both computers should be set up (If it doesnt work on my laptop I may setup a way to remote in to my desktop instead)
No progress set on subsystem introduction, though after our presentation on 9/30 I will have consdierably more time to work on it (Also wont be studying as much for exams)

Overall, not pleased w/ progress, but not completely unexpected. May have extra time this week to push ahead though.
