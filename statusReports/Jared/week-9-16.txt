Received ESP32-DEVKITC-32E from digikey (Did not order through the department, my bad), began downloading software onto desktop and laptop to begin learning how to use esp32.
Finsihed assigned section of conops and reviewed before submission.

Need to begin work on FSD, ICD, milestones, and validation plans (due sep 26).
Need to check that I have all materials to work with esp32 (specifically cords and elec components), if not go get them.
Aim to have a "hello world" done for next week and also blink an LED
