This week I worked on the (hopefully) final PCB for our auxilliary board. Meaning slightly reduced size, fixes to getting power on the board,
adding fixes regarding the ADC (e.g. filtering, resistors missed in inital design, and changing the SPI connections pins to the ESP32), and adding mounting points.

By  the end of this week I hope to have the board finished and ordered (all parts included)

While parts are coming in, I will continue to work on integration with the main MCU and hopefully the phone app (can't with DAC system until ADC works).
This means:
-Check that uart signals from my esp32 are received and processed by the main msp430
-Check how the app wants data to be sent/received , ensure I have proper formatting, then test with connecting to the actual app.

Codewise:
-Update code to reflect new board
-Work on old code for current integration work (which can be mostly transffered to new boards change in code)
